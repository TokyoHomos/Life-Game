# Life-Game


Description Game:

Game of Life is a simulation game based on a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive (represented by 1) or dead (represented by 0). The game is inspired by cellular automata and models the evolution of life using simple rules. Each cellâ€™s state in the next generation depends on the number of alive neighboring cells, simulating the behavior of living organisms.

In this simulation:

If a cell is alive and has 2 or 3 alive neighbors, it continues to live.

If a cell is alive and has more than 3 alive neighbors, it dies from overcrowding.

If a cell is alive and has fewer than 2 neighbors, it dies from loneliness.

If a cell is dead and exactly 3 of its neighbors are alive, it becomes alive, symbolizing birth or reproduction.

The game does not require any user input during the simulation, as the system updates automatically with each generation, creating new patterns. Players can, however, set an initial state by placing alive cells on the grid. From there, the game evolves by itself according to the rules.

The purpose of the game is not to win or lose but to observe how simple rules can create complex, unpredictable, and sometimes beautiful patterns. These patterns can stabilize, oscillate, or even spread endlessly. It serves as a visual and mathematical exploration of how life-like behavior can emerge from simplicity.

Game of Life is widely known in the world of computer science, mathematics, and artificial life studies. It helps in understanding systems, logic, and simulation modeling. Although this version of the game is simple, it opens the door to creative experimentation, where users can test different starting patterns and observe how they evolve over time.

This project demonstrates how basic programming and logical thinking can create a simulation that resembles natural processes and behaviors.
